# Netflix Homepage Clone

This project is a static clone of the Netflix homepage, created using only pure HTML and CSS. It's a front-end project focused on replicating the visual layout and design of the Netflix landing page.

## Features

-   **Responsive Header:** The navigation bar and header section adapt to different screen sizes.
-   **Hero Section:** Replicates the main "Unlimited movies, TV shows, and more" section.
-   **Feature Sections:** Includes the various content sections ("Enjoy on your TV," "Download your shows," etc.) with alternating text and image/video layouts.
-   **FAQ Section:** A recreation of the frequently asked questions accordion (note: this is a visual clone; the JavaScript for toggle functionality is not included).
-   **Footer:** A multi-column footer, just like the original.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the webpage.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling, layout (using Flexbox and Grid), and responsiveness.
